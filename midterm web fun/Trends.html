	This week in Milan, there was much to covet for next season: Gucci's '70's suits, Prada's stacked seashell necklaces, and Salvatore Ferragamo's Viva pumps were among the runway's most sought-after. But while patience is a virtue, it's this season's aspirational hair and makeup strategies that offer instant gratification. Craving a change? Consider a fresh set of micro-bangs in the vain of Gucci. Need a dose of color? Look no further than Versace's swooshes of neon tangerine liner. How about a touch of whimsy? Finish off a messy French twist with fresh flowers like a Missoni girl. Whether a referential riff like Moschino's Picasso-inspired, paint-splotched updos or a decidedly modern proposition such as subbing out concealer for a cascade of glitter in the spirit of Fendi, the shows served up endless possibilities for a transformative above-neck moment. Here, five beauty takeaways from this week's shows in the Italian fashion capital.

<b>Braids Dazzle in Many Forms</b>
	<p>
		At Max Mara's female spy saluting show, hairstylist Sam McKnight wove streamlined twin plaits inspired by a Hans Feurer photograph he found in a '70's era issue of Nova magazine that played well with the ccollection's army caps. Taking a duo of plaits into the more avant-garde realm, at Stella Jean one braid was sculpted along the forehead while the other was slung across the opposite shoulder and cast in jewel toned yarn. Then, at Sportmax, models with natural curls such as Hiandra Martinez received equal parts delicate and intricate vertical cornrows, while at Gucci, braider Latarra was brought in to give several models close cropped, geometric braids to dizzying effect.

	<b>Updos Are a Work of Art</b>
<p>
	A master of many trades, which include painting, sculpting, and drawing, multimedia hair artist Julien d Y's administered gestural strokes of red, pink, blue, green, and yellow on the Spanish style chignons at Moschino. Every woman looks beautiful with this style it's very strong, he proclaimed. The next day, he switched mediums, crafting individual clay sliced, floral bedecked updos at Marni. And at Missoni, hairstylist Anthony Turner’s messy French twists were also garden fresh, featuring sprigs of fresh flowers pinned in the back.

<b>Graphic Eyes Get Bolder, Brighter</b>
<p>
	It’s really about the woman who has no fear with makeup, explained Pat McGrath backstage at Prada, where she brushed geometric swathes of black pigment on the lids and, in some instances, bleached brows to punctuate the look. At Versace, she encased eyes in a similar swooped shape along the brow bone with diffused neon bright pigment. For Salvatore Ferragamo, Fara Homidi also presented a painterly finish with a multi colored, color block abstract expressionist eye to complement the collections Venetian glass inspired accessories.
