	<h1> Following Day 1 of Forces of Fashion, Everyone Gathered for a Dinner </h1>
	<p>
		Day one of Forces of Fashion went out with a bang. Cardi B was presented with a tricked out custom cake in honor of the singer’s 27th birthday.

After the candles were blown out, the party continued into the evening. Conference panelists, designers, and honored guests migrated from Spring Studios to King, Sohos southern Italian Bistro, for a pasta supper cohosted by luxury One and Only Resorts. (After the marathon-like fashion conference, carbs were required!)

<p>
The group, which included the likes of Kaia Gerber and Cindy Crawford, Olivier Rousteing, and Prabal Gurung, recapped the day. There was much to discuss. Like Thelma Golden and Tyler Mitchells thought-provoking conversation on his historic September cover shoot (the 24-year-old photographer adorably admitted that when he got the call to shoot Beyonce for Vogues 2018 September issue, he thought he was being punked) or Cardi Bs impromptu acapella of Hilary Duffs “Hey Now” (she claims the song pumps her up!), which had all the Millenials in the audience buzzing with nostalgia.

<p>
During cocktail hour, guests got cozy with each other the tiny restaurant was filled shoulder to shoulder sipping Perrier Jouet Grand Brut and Negronis. Gerber was greeted with congratulation and praise for the far beyond her years eloquence she displayed during her panel discussion. Honestly, she said, I was so nervous going up there. I’ve never done anything like that before, but I was glad to have my mom on stage with me.
</p>
<p>
Other guests were prepping for the day ahead Forces of Fashion is just half over, after all! Vogue contributor Lynn Yaeger was on the hunt for Rousteing as she had a few more points to nail down before pair’s panel on day two.
</p>
<p>
After the candlelit dinner, everyone felt recharged for yet another day of talking shop. As the clock struck 10, farewells began to echo throughout the room and air kisses were exchanged—until tomorrow, everyone!
